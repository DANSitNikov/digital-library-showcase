## Platform Choice

I deployed this project to Vercel.
It is the most natural fit for a Next.js App Router project because it
supports SSR, ISR, routing, and metadata behavior out of the box with
minimal deployment config.

## Production URL

- https://digital-library-showcase.vercel.app/en

## Delivery Setup

- GitHub is connected to Vercel for continuous delivery.
- Each push/PR gets a preview deployment.
- Merges to the main branch update production.
- Environment variables are configured in Vercel Project Settings.

## Runtime Notes

- Deep links to book pages work directly in production
  (example: `/en/{id}`).
- Build-time and runtime behavior match local Next.js behavior.
- Metadata and Open Graph tags are generated by Next.js metadata APIs
  and can be validated on deployed URLs.
