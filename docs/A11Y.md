# Accessibility

## Current Practices

- I tried to use semantic tags and meaningful structure (`header`,
  `main`, `footer`, headings, form controls).
- I checked keyboard navigation manually using `Tab`, `Shift+Tab`,
  `Enter`, and `Space` to make sure the main flows are accessible
  without a mouse.
- I also tested the app with a screen reader (speech output) to verify
  that content is announced correctly for users who cannot see the UI.
- I used proper labels and ARIA where needed.
- I kept color contrast in mind when building UI styles and tokens.
- I also used Lighthouse to check accessibility, and I provide a
  screenshot below.

## UI Tokens Baseline

Most styles are based on Tailwind CSS design choices.
I used Tailwind as a baseline because it provides strong defaults for
colors, spacing, typography, radius, and shadow scales.
From that baseline, I created my own CSS variables and
used them consistently across the app.

## Linting

ESLint is configured with accessibility-focused rules.
